# GraphFP:a dynamic inference software for reconstructing the cell state-transition complex energy landscape from time series single-cell transcriptomic data

GraphFP can reconstruct cell state potential energies which measure their differentiation potencies, 
faithfully chart the probability flows between paired cell states over the dynamic processes of cell differentiation, 
and accurately quantify the stochastic dynamics of the cell type frequencies on probability simplex in continuous time.

The main part of GraphFP is performed in R, 

Before using GraphFP, please install PETSc and MPI in advance. 
The version of  used in GraphFP is 3.11.4, 
The version of  used in GraphFP is 3.11.4 with external package ' '.
