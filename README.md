# GraphFPï¼Œa dynamic inference software for reconstructing the cell state-transition complex energy landscape from time series single-cell transcriptomic data

GraphFP can reconstruct cell state potential energies which measure their differentiation potencies, 
faithfully chart the probability flows between paired cell states over the dynamic processes of cell differentiation, 
and accurately quantify the stochastic dynamics of the cell type frequencies on probability simplex in continuous time.

The main part of GraphFP is performed in R, 

Before using GraphFP, please install PETSc and MPI in advance. 
The installation of MPI can be done when install PETSc. 
The version of PETSc used in D-EE is 3.11.4 (https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/download/index.html), 
The version of PETSc used in D-EE is 3.11.4 with external package 'elemental'.
