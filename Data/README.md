#Data

We evaluated the performance of GraphFP using the time series scRNA-seq data set of embryonic murine cerebral cortex development (Yuzwa et al., 2017, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.12.017). 
This data set was analyzed by Tempora (Tran and Bader, 2020, https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008205). 
We downloaded the processed data, including the cell type annotations, provided by Tempora at https://www.baderlab.org/Software/Tempora.
